* klin - functionality for my science writing workflow
** misc notes

TODO: 
- make a minor mode enabled in .bib files that has the functionality i need

TODO: 
- make buffer-local keys in .bib file to trigger the various function
- EARLIER: use the widget-library: show the keybindings in an attached small help buffer
  - ACTUALLY: No, just create a package with some documentation. There, you can write down
    what functions are useful.
